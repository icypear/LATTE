# LATTE
LATTE employs Efficient Multiscale Spatial Aggregation (EMSA) to capture spatial features across scales, Memory Attention Aggregation (MAA) to enhance temporal modeling, and Auxiliary Self-Attention Aggregation (AAA) to extract latent dependencies over extended sequences. Additionally, LATTE incorporates the Flamingo Alert-Assisted System (FAA), leveraging a vision-language model to provide real-time, interpretable verbal hazard alerts, improving passenger situational awareness. Evaluations on benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate LATTE’s superior predictive capabilities and computational efficiency. On the DAD dataset, LATTE achieves an AP of 89.74\%, a 149.44\% improvement in mean time-to-accident (mTTA), and a 494.12\% increase in TTA@R80 compared to state-of-the-art methods. Its lightweight design delivers a 93.14\% reduction in floating-point operations (FLOPs) and a 31.58\% decrease in parameter count (Params), enabling real-time operation on resource-limited hardware without compromising performance. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of LATTE’s architectural components, while visualizations and failure case analyses highlight its practical applicability and areas for enhancement.
